# restapi — Design Decisions & Session Notes

This file exists so that Claude sessions working in this repo don't re-litigate settled
decisions or re-discover the same issues from scratch. It is local to this repo (not tied to
any one machine's global Claude memory), so it travels with the code.

**Maintenance rule:** when a standing decision changes, update the section below in place
(don't just append a contradiction lower down). When a new investigation/session produces a
decision, finding, or reverted approach worth remembering, add a dated entry under Session Log.
Keep entries terse — this is a reference, not a transcript.

## Standing design decisions & constraints

- **Vulnerability/review threat model: externally-exploitable only.** This library is a power
  tool for developers building their own services, not a hardened black box. When reviewing for
  "vulnerabilities," only count issues reachable from a downstream, untrusted HTTP/WebSocket
  client hitting a service built on the framework (anonymous or low-privilege caller). Do NOT
  flag: developer-only footguns (misusing an API, a decorator applied wrong in your own code),
  internal utilities only the operator touches (build/CLI/startup wiring), or purely theoretical
  races with no concrete external trigger path. Every finding should be able to name the actual
  HTTP route/method or WS message type that reaches the code in question.

- **Commit discipline.** Don't `git commit` unless explicitly asked, even after a full
  review-and-fix cycle with passing tests. Leave changes staged/unstaged and say so.
- **Commit message style: concise, one line per task/bug/feature — no verbose prose.** A commit
  message is a short list of one-line bullets, one per item. Never a paragraph explaining what was
  done or why for any single item — that belongs in the diff/code comments/NOTES.md, not the commit
  message. This mirrors JP's standing convention across his other repos.

## Session Log

### 2026-09-06 — Repo split: `@rapidrest/mail` → four RapidMX packages

- **This repo is `@rapidmx/restapi`**, carved out of the former monolith `@rapidrest/mail`
  (`d:\github\rapidrest\mail`, still present there for reference/history — nothing was deleted from
  it as part of this split). It keeps everything **except** Exchange ActiveSync, MAPI over HTTP, and
  Autodiscover, which became their own independently-versioned sibling packages:
  `@rapidmx/activesync`, `@rapidmx/mapi`, `@rapidmx/autodiscover`. All three depend on this package
  for models, REST-layer utilities (`FolderUtils`/`MailSendUtils`/`MailboxScopeUtils`/
  `RecoverableRepoUtils`), blob storage, and the scan pipeline.
- **New public surface added specifically to support the split**: `src/util/index.ts` (a barrel for
  the four utilities named above) is now re-exported from the package root. It didn't exist before
  the split — `src/util/*` was previously internal-only, but `activesync`/`mapi` both import these
  files directly, so they needed to become real exports.
  `src/util/OptionalDeps.ts` (`importOptional()`) was deliberately **not** added to this barrel — it's
  an internal helper for this package's own optional peer dependencies (PDF/DOCX extraction,
  OpenSearch), nothing downstream needs it.
  Dropped instead: `./eas`, `./mapi`, `./autodiscover` `package.json` export subpaths and their
  backing `src/eas.ts`/`src/mapi.ts`/`src/autodiscover.ts` flat barrels, and the corresponding
  `export * from "./eas/mongo.js"` (etc.) lines in `src/mongo.ts`/`src/sql.ts` — that source moved out
  entirely, not just its export path.
- **`ical.js`/`vcard4` dropped as dependencies** — confirmed via an exhaustive grep across the entire
  former monolith's `src/`/`test/` that neither package was imported anywhere. Dead dependency debt
  from an earlier design, not something removed by the split itself; simply not carried forward.
- **Local dev linking for the three add-on packages**: each depends on this package via Yarn Berry's
  `portal:../restapi` in their own `devDependencies` (plus a real `peerDependencies` semver range for
  when this package is actually published) — no publish needed for local development, since all four
  repos live as siblings under `d:\github\rapidmx\`.
- If you're investigating something that touches EAS/MAPI/Autodiscover-specific behavior, it isn't
  here anymore — check the relevant sibling repo's own `.claude/NOTES.md` first, and the original
  monolith's `.claude/NOTES.md` (`d:\github\rapidrest\mail`) for the original design rationale behind
  code that predates the split.
- **Inherited, pre-existing coverage gap (not introduced by the split)**: a full `vitest run --coverage`
  lands at 99.65%/98.03%/99.54%/99.71% (stmt/branch/func/line), just under the 100% stmt/func/line
  threshold, in the exact same handful of files the original monolith already carried this gap in
  (`CalendarStorageRecalcJob.ts`, `ScanQueueJob.ts`, `CalendarShareLinkRoute.ts`, `FolderRoute.ts`,
  `MailIngestRoute.ts`, `MailboxRoute.ts`, `MessageRoute.ts`, `ChildRoute.ts`, `MailboxRouteMongo.ts`/
  `SQL.ts`, `ScanPipeline.ts`, `PlainTextExtractor.ts`). This code moved unchanged from the monolith - it's
  the same debt, not a new one. A full suite run also hit one confirmed-transient
  `MongoNetworkError: ECONNRESET` in `test/routes/mongo/FolderRoute.test.ts` under load, reproduced passing
  20/20 in isolation immediately after - a `mongodb-memory-server` flakiness issue, not a real regression
  (same pattern the monolith's own NOTES.md already documented for a different test file).

### 2026-09-06 — Fixed: a brand-new mailbox had zero folders, breaking both the webmail inbox and Compose

JP reported (via `@rapidmx/server`'s admin console) that a mailbox he'd just created showed a
"no mailbox available" error the moment he tried to access it in webmail. Root cause traced here,
not in `server`.

- **`findOrCreateWellKnownFolder`'s well-known folders (Inbox, Junk, Sent Items, ...) are all
  provisioned lazily** (see its own doc comment) — the only callers were `ScanQueueJob` (Inbox/Junk,
  on first delivered message) and `BaseMessageRoute.send()` (Sent Items, on first send).
  `BaseMailboxRoute.create()` never created any folder at all. A mailbox that has never received or
  sent mail therefore has **zero** folders, including no Inbox — genuinely correct for Junk/Sent
  Items (an unused mailbox shouldn't have an empty Junk folder cluttering its tree), but Inbox is
  load-bearing: any webmail client built expecting `folders.find(f => f.type === "inbox")` to exist
  (as `@rapidmx/server`'s `MailShell` does) has nothing to select and shows an empty/broken state,
  even though the mailbox itself was created successfully. Drafts has the identical problem one step
  later: `server`'s Compose page reads `folders.find(f => f.type === "drafts")` before it will create
  a new draft at all.
- **Fix, in `BaseMailboxRoute.create()`**: after creating the mailbox (single or bulk), eagerly call
  `findOrCreateWellKnownFolder()` for `FolderType.INBOX` and `FolderType.DRAFTS` only — every other
  well-known folder stays lazy, unchanged. `folderClass` is now an abstract field on
  `BaseMailboxRoute` (mirroring `BaseMessageRoute`'s existing pattern exactly), supplied by
  `MailboxRouteMongo`/`MailboxRouteSQL` as `FolderMongo`/`FolderSQL`. Any other subclass of
  `BaseMailboxRoute` (none exist outside this package today) will fail to compile until it supplies
  one too — deliberate, not an oversight.
  New coverage: `test/routes/{mongo,sql}/MailboxRoute.test.ts` each gained a test asserting
  `GET /folders?mailboxUid=` returns exactly `["drafts", "inbox"]` immediately after `POST
  /mailboxes`. `test/routes/BaseMailboxRoute.test.ts`'s bare `TestMailboxRoute` needed a dummy
  `folderClass = Object` added purely to satisfy the new abstract member (its tests never reach
  `create()` — they're `repoUtils`-guard-clause-only, per that file's own header comment).
- **Verification**: this package's own `yarn build`/full `yarn vitest run` both clean (820/820). Then
  verified the actual end-to-end symptom is gone via `@rapidmx/server`: `yarn patch
  @rapidmx/restapi` + replace the extracted copy's `dist/` with this package's freshly-built one +
  `yarn patch-commit` (temporary, for verification only — this package's own version was **not**
  bumped or published; JP still needs to publish a real new version and `server` will then move off
  the patch back onto a plain registry range), `yarn dev` in `server`, then `curl`'d a real
  `POST /api/mail/mailboxes` followed by `GET /api/mail/folders?mailboxUid=...` and confirmed both
  Inbox and Drafts come back immediately, plus `GET /admin/mailboxes/detail?uid=...` and
  `GET /?mailboxUid=...` both `200`. See `@rapidmx/server`'s own NOTES.md for the patch-application
  side of this if picking the follow-up (moving off the patch once published) back up later.
